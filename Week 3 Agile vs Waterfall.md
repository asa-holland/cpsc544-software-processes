1. Does Agile solve all challenges faced by a Waterfall model?
I don't believe so. While Agile addresses issues such as inflexibility and limited stakeholder feedback through iterative development and continuous communication, it introduces its own set of challenges, such as potential lack of documentation and the difficulty of managing scope creep. Although I don't work in this kind of environment, I can imagine how certain organizations or situations where requirements are reliably stable and well-defined. In these instances, Waterfall’s structured approach could still be more effective. That said, I work in the medical field, and for highly regulated industries like medical that prioritize compliance and documentation, Waterfall may remain preferable despite its limitations.

2. In your opinion, does it make sense in 2024 to be executing a Waterfall methodology for any reason?
Yes, I believe so. For some projects with fixed requirements and timelines, such as government contracts, large-scale infrastructure projects, or certain healthcare initiatives, Waterfall could still be applicable regardless of the duration. In these contexts, the predictability and clarity provided by Waterfall's sequential phases and detailed documentation are essential for compliance and stakeholder assurance. There also could be some other industries that require rigorous documentation for regulatory purposes that may find Waterfall’s structure to be advantageous.

3. Why do you think modern organizations switch to or have already gone to Agile?
This is most likely due to the adaptability of Agile in fast-paced environments. I've worked for a few different companies at this point, but the adaptability of how Agile can be applied to shifting priorities is a common thread across different industries and domains. Agile methodologies promote a culture of collaboration, allowing teams to respond quickly to changing market demands and customer feedback. This responsiveness enhances product quality and customer satisfaction, as features can be iteratively developed and refined based on user input. I think that Agile’s focus on continuous improvement can also encourage innovation and help organizations reduce risk by identifying issues early in the development process, making it an attractive choice for organizations seeking competitive advantage.
